<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I create an automation of a Python Script that queries for CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and generates a list that is easily readable use JSON. information when provided with a URL. We code using Virtual Studio Code (any python environment can be used) and couple libraries that you may need to import. Lets get right into this step by step guide!
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>JSON</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Virtual Studio Code</b> 

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

Import these two libraries in order to parse the data from the sites, "import requests queries for data within a URL and then "import JSON" converts those queries into readable data: <br/>

Here is the formatted final code, I created a function that parses the JSON dictionaries keys, summary and id: <br/>

Here is the output, as you can see the list of vulnerabilities, with a summary and the ID:  <br/>

This Concludes This Autoomation Python Script Project!
NOTE: You can add onto this and make it more complex, or use these methonds to automate other tasks!  <br/>
